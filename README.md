# cse-2102

# Labs:

First, we start by cloning the local repositories 

to clone this repo in your terminal we put

```git clone https://github.com/AdrianG0954/cse-2102.git```

after cloning we changed our current directory to the lab 

for example:

```cd Cse-2102/Lab#EXAMPLE```

after making sure we are in the right directory we compile and run the Java code like so

compile: ```javac TestMe.java```

run: ```java TestMe```
